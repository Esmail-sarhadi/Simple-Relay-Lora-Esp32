# Simple-Relay-Lora-Esp32
This project demonstrates a simple communication system using LoRa modules (RFM95) with Arduino. The setup includes a master device that sends commands and receives data, and a slave device that responds to commands and sends acknowledgments. The communication happens at a frequency of 433.0 MHz.
